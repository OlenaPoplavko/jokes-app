## What I would add with more time

I implemented the core logic of the app: fetching jokes from an API, displaying punchlines, saving favorites, page navigation, refresh functionality, basic styling, and error handling.

If I had more time, I would also add:

- the ability to remove saved jokes;
- a small notification when a joke is saved;
- saving favorite jokes to localStorage;
- using useReducer instead of multiple useState hooks;
- improved styling and mobile responsiveness.
